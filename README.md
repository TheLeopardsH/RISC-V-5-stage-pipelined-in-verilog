# RISC-V-5-stage-pipelined-in-verilog
RISC-V PIPELINED PROCESSOR IN VERILOG.
The Project is done in Embedded system design course for design of 5- stage pipelined RISC-V processor in Verilog supporting all formats of 32IM of RISC-V ISA.

Note:The project is under construction and I am  adding new features like Caches design,Floating point etc.Thank you
